-----------------------------------

Have you ever thought about practicing your English through natural conversation and being corrected every time you make a mistake? That was my project idea to improve my skills and seek opportunities in the market as a Developer.

To achieve this, I used the ChatGPT API to identify and dynamically correct errors. The technologies I used were MySQL, React Query, Next, Prisma, and Next Auth.

In the project, you start the chat by writing about the subject you want to talk about or even just any title. Then, you ask the first question or talk about yourself in English, and the chatbot will understand and continue the conversation, correcting your mistakes.
